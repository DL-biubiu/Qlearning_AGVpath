# Qlearning_AGVpath
Demonstrate the Q-Learning approach for AGV path planning

Execute "run.py" to open the demonstrate UI.
The UI shows how AGV agent learn how to avoid the new obstacle in the path by reinforcement learning skill.
The UI not only demonstrate the effect of Q-Learning but the A-star and Dijkstra path algorithm as well.
Set the position (x, y) of the starting and goal point for AGV and the position of the obstacles then press "start".
